An alarm clock I made with HTML, javascript, CSS, jquery, and Google's dat.GUI library.

I wanted an easy way to wake myself up in the morning with songs off my linux filesystem, so I made one.
It should work just fine on Windows and Mac as well but I haven't tested it.

I use Chromium as my browser, and there may be browser issues with it. It also uses javascript date objects, so its based off your hardware clock. If you hardware clock is wrong, beware.
